##ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,


I'm currently studying at a coding bootcamp called Kodehode, where Iâ€™m specializing in backend development. I have a strong focus on C#, and I enjoy building scalable, efficient systems that solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies and improve my skills through hands-on projects.

ðŸ”§ Skills:

   - Backend Development
   - C# / .NET
   - APIs & Microservices
   - Database Management


```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name = "Eirik";
    public int Age = 35;
    public List<string> interests =
    [
        "Coding",
        "Gaming",
        "Parenting",
        "Formula 1",
        "Weighlifting",
        "Cycling",
    ];
}
```
